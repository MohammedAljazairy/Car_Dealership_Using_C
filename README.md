The objective of the project is to make a simple C program that uses file, structs, and pointers.
The project is stright foward you just launch the source.cpp or .exe to the project you met the menu 
The menu is divied into 3 categories, add either a car or customer , remove a car or customer or search for a car or customer.
to fill the information you are met with a text tells you the order filling you either either enter to get to the other part or press space, for more explaination on how to run the program there are screenshots.
ps. because the project was made intentionally for egyptian numbers you will find that it prints in the file 0 then only takes 11 numbers after the zero you can change that in the code if you like.

Happy Coding!
